 <!-- 
 1. HTML5 semantic tags are more discriptive.  they are used to help break up meadia pages, give anyone reading your code an idea of what you are doing, and helpful to screen readers that people with disabilities might use.  I think the aside, and footer would probably be most useful because they are the most unique ive seen so far
 2. from top to bottom displaying things that are meant to be seen on the screen.  elements like aside can push things over but you would add the code in between the aside tags. 
 3. i learned about differnet sublime snippets and how to create my own.  i defieantly see how useful they are and if i see the i need one that sublime hasn't already made, i would create one.  or if i am creating a certing type of page that has a lot of repatition it would b very helpful for the.  
 4. i am still a little weary on exactly what DOCTYPE is.  I aslo feel i need a lot of practice making snippets.  Lastly i need to feel more comfortable with the different HTLM% elements and where they go.  I understand what most of the ones we learned do i just need to figure which tags belong in which tags and such.  -->
